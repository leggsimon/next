# Frequently asked questions

## How do I get in touch with the Next team?

You can get in touch with us on
[next.feedback@ft.com](mailto:next.feedback@ft.com), visit us in Southwark
Bridge, Floor 3, Block A.

The team also hang out in
[Slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next/).

## How does Next fit with Origami?

We use almost all the tools and components the Origami team have produced and
we are a regular contributor back to those tools.  We envisage that many of the
components we are building in Next will eventually transfer to being owned by
the Origami team.  We also use [Origami Build
Tools](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-build-tools) to build all of
Next's applications' styling and client side JavaScript.

## How does Next fit with FT Platform?

Optimising speed to market is one of the fundamental principles of Next.  In
order to achieve this we have built our own deployment mechanism on top of
Heroku, called [Haikro](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/haikro), which is
also being trialled by the web app team, [the Origami
team](https://twitter.com/SamuelGiles_/status/558635929133666305), and
Interactive Graphics.  It is crucial that Next infrastructure is simple and
fast enough so that every member of the Next development team is able to
provision servers and deploy code for their services within minutes.

Previous attempts to integrate Next with FT Platform have demonstrated that it
is not yet ready to be used in this way and so we have decided for now not to
use FT Platform.

## What is the support agreement of Next?

We have different service levels for different services that make up Next.  [Current and planned service levels are documented on our ‘radiator’ app.](http://next-radiator.ft.com/apps)

We currently consider the **opt out journey** as a Platinum level service.  We guarantee the customer can always get to content either on Next or by opting out and going back to FT.com.  [How we meet the requirements of Platinum-level product tier.]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview/platinum)

The rest of Next is a [Bronze-level product](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R2cm_MkcLKe6ceoIiFYfnkbE-gXjNMs9JTbvUXbSrs0). This means it's not classed as business-critical and support out-of-hours is 'best efforts' with longer allowance for recovery times. The level of support is agreed with the product management team.

As we invite more traffic on to Next the need to provide greater support will grow.
