# Logging defects 

You think you've found a problem or defect on Next and wonder what to do?
Here's some guidance from the team.

## Urgent problems

Serious problems requiring immediate attention should be raised in person
and/or on [Slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next-support/)
to ensure someone is taking responsibility for resolving them.

Inside office hours this should get immediate attention. We are working towards
providing [24/7
support](http://financial-times.github.io/next/docs/overview/platinum/) for
some of our critical services over the autumn.

## Nextians

If you work on the Next project and find a problem outside of your team you
should go and talk to someone (in person, on Slack etc ...) who is responsible
for it and decide what to do about it. i.e. fix it immediately, log it, ignore
it.

Use whatever process the team has to deal with minor things that need doing -
whiteboards, Trello, to-do lists, pieces of paper... We don’t want to create
bureaucracy or add barriers to fixing simple things.

## Contact us

We have several other ways logging problems for both customers and FT staff.

#### Defects 

- [https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT](https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT) for staff.

#### Email

- [next.feedback@ft.com](mailto:next.feedback@ft.com) for customers.
- [next.team@ft.com](mailto:next.team@ft.com) for staff.
 
#### Slack

- [ft-next-feedback](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next-feedback/) for customers (this is a stream of opt-out messages).
- [ft-next-support](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next-support/) for staff.

#### Feedback survey

- [https://next.ft.com/survey](https://next.ft.com/survey) for customers.

#### Humans

We also have a team of customer services, product consultants and assorted
other ways of discovering valuable information about problems people are
having. These are all fed back in to one of the above channels.

## But where do I log my bug

Jira is probably the best place to put something if you want to log it and make
sure it doesn’t get lost. We will direct customer services and other FT teams
at this as a first port of call.

[Jay](mailto:jay.sethi@ft.com) owns the responsibility of triaging Jira and
communicating it the relevant teams, and ensuring any priorities are raised.

_Nb. Jira is not a place for user stories, or feature requests or an excuse not
to talk to each other directly. Bugs that haven’t been resolved will be
automatically closed after a few weeks._
