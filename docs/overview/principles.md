# Principles of Next

This strategy commits us to the following principles.

## 1. Everything driven by user needs

Next should be **universal** (portable across screens, formats, mediums,
&hellip;), **simple** (the most intuitive journeys), **fast** (to load, find
and enjoy).

New functionality should be proven to add value, both qualitatively
and quantitatively.

We prototype to understand these needs.

## 2. Optimised for speed to market

When new pieces of features are ready they should start delivering business
value immediately. We aim to minimise and eliminate barriers to creating and
maintaining customer facing services.

Changes to Next should be measured in seconds, not weeks.

## 3. Easy to use

Every layer of Next, from the CDN to the individual applications, should be
simple and well documented enough to allow any developer at the FT to get up
and running on any part of Next within a few minutes.

APIs and automation.

## 4. A cohesive product

Seemless - Connecting all parts of the FT seamlessly

Interconnected - Links & metadata are as valuable as the content itself

Next should represent the most efficient way to deliver applications to the
FT's customers.

Although most of Next is built with Node.js and we maintain tools that make
writing Next applications with JavaScript easier, we do not force developers to
use that or any other language for their applications' backend.

## 5. Future-proof

We are building Next with today's best practises whilst keeping in mind
emerging technologies that will enable to us to build richer, faster and more
integrated user experiences in the future.

## 6. Encouragement and evangelism

We'll make it easy to create new applications, run A/B tests, make changes to
core Next applications, and we'll inform and educate throughout the business to
advocate using our components so we get maximum value out of them.
