# Principles of Next

This strategy commits us to the following principles.

## 1. Everything driven by user needs

Next should be **universal** (portable across screens, formats, mediums, &hellip;), **simple** (the most intuitive journeys), **fast** (to load, find and enjoy).  New functionality should be A/B tested to verify their efficacy.

## 2. Optimised for speed to market

When new pieces of features are ready they should start delivering business value immediately.  We aim to minimise and eliminate barriers to creating and maintaining customer facing services.

## 3. Easy to use

Every layer of Next, from the CDN to the individual applications, should be simple and well documented enough to allow any developer at the FT to get up and running on any part of Next within a few minutes.

## 4. No opinion on how you should build your application

Although most of Next is built with Node.js and we maintain tools that make writing Next applications with JavaScript easier, we do not force developers to use that or any other language for their applications' backend.

## 5. Future-proof

We are building Next with today's best practises whilst keeping in mind emerging technologies that will in the future enable to us to build richer, faster and more integrated user experiences in the future.

## 6. Encouragement and evangelism

We'll make it easy to create new applications, run A/B tests, make changes to core Next applications, and we'll inform and educate throughout the business to advocate using our components so we get maximum value out of them.
