# Bug duty

Every day one developer is assigned to bug duty.  The person on bug duty works
on the following sorts of problems prioritised in the following order.

1. Live production issues (anything causing our pingdom alerts to fail).
1. Responding to user feedback/bug reports sent to [next.feedback@ft.com](https://groups.google.com/a/ft.com/forum/#!forum/next.feedback).
1. Serious issues reported via
[Slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next/) or other channels
(non-serious issues should be filed in [JIRA](https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT)).
1. Live code errors that have been caught by
[Sentry](https://app.getsentry.com/nextftcom/).
1. More fine grained alerts appear in [Sensu](http://sensu.ft.com)
1. Issues filed in [JIRA](https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT).
1. Maintaining the documentation.
