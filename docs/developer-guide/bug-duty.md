# Bug duty

Every day one developer is assigned to bug duty.  The person on bug duty works on the following sorts of problems prioritised in the following order.

1. Live production issues (anything causing our pingdom alerts to fail).
2. Serious issues reported via [slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/ft-next/) or other channels (non-serious issues should be filed in [JIRA](https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT)).
3. Live code errors that have been caught by [Sentry](https://app.getsentry.com/nextftcom/).
4. Issues filed in [JIRA](https://jira.ft.com/browse/NFT).
