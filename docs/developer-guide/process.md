# Process

Next uses a simple, [lightweight](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) process to
help communicate what everyone is working on.

The emphasis is on small teams, self-organisation, incremental delivery, and [short
feedback
loops](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/09/good-enough-never-is-or-is-it.html)

We pracitise [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery](continuous
delivery) to remove the risks around software delivery.

## Quarterly

At the outset of every quarter (i.e. 12 weeks) teams get together to discuss
their objectives.

Here are the current plans for Q2, May - July 2015 :-

Here's the [Q1 plan](http://matt.chadburn.co.uk/drop/q1.next.png).

## Weekly

On **Monday** at 10am the whole team meets for an hour or so to discuss the week
ahead and the week just gone. 

Next values independent thought. Make sure you come to this meeting with a plan
with what you want to achieve for the week. Ideally you'll be focussed on
improving a specific metric or two. 

Every **Thursday** a product manager will ask you to help compile a list of
things your team have done this week. 'Done' typically means running in
production. 

Every **Friday** afternoon the project's stakeholders meet to discuss the
week's actvities and have a chance to feedback before the following Monday.

## Misc.

Every other **Tuesday** we have a team retrospective. This gives everyone an
opportunity to reflect on what improvements we need to make.

Every other **Friday** you'll be asked to present your work at the department's
showcase. This helps explain our progress to the wider team.

Every two weeks, typically on **Thursdays**, there's a user testing session in
the office. Speak to Jess if you want to get involved.
