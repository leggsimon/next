# Browser support

Next uses [the 'Cuts the mustard' approach](http://origami.ft.com/docs/developer-guide/using-modules/#core-vs-enhanced-experience), as described in Origami.

## Enhanced experience

Currently we support all the browsers with either the green or greenish colour [indicated on this page](http://caniuse.com/#search=matches).  We aim to expand this over time.

## Core experience

Core experience should be supported across all browsers covered by the [standard FT browser support policy](https://docs.google.com/a/ft.com/document/d/1dX92MPm9ZNY2jqFidWf_E6V4S6pLkydjcPmk5F989YI/edit).
