## Frequently asked questions

### I work for the FT or a Pearson company but don't have an FT.com account, is there a generic account I can use to login?

We're trying to avoid usage of *Next* by generic accounts as much of Next's featureset relies on personalisation.  [FT.com Premium subscriptions can be requested by following the instructions on Neo](https://neo.pearson.com/community/enabling-functions/ges-human-resources/reward/my_benefits_uk/blog/2012/10/09/ftcom-subscriptions).
